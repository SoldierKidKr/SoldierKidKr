- 👋 Hi, I’m @SoldierKidKr
- 👀 I’m a communication expert soldier-enlisted- of Republic of Korea Air Force
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java programming, Kubernetes, Docker and CI/CD since I manage a new system that contains PaaS solutions and docker files that are written in java language
- 💞️ I made a repository to record my study progresses so that I can keep focusing on my work and getting motivations
- 📫 My repositorys would be all private but one day I will make it public when I think I'm ready
